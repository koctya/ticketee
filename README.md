# Rails 4 ticketee app from Rails in Action MEAP
following along with the new book to learn whats new in Rails 4

## Changes from Rails Book
I prefer Sass syntax so I added the following line to the application.rb

        config.sass.preferred_syntax = :sass

I also added haml-rails gem to the Gemfile so that all templates will be created using Haml instead of Erb, Thus all my views will be somewhat different from the books version.
